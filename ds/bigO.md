# Big O notation
The notation used to describe runtime.
O(n) is read as: "oh of n" "big oh of n", or "order n"
O(1) is constant time or "oh of one"
O(n) is linear
O(n^2) is quadratic
O(2^n) is exponential
O(logn) is logarithmic
As described prior:
We care about worst case, even if your algorithm can stop early like the linear search.
We don't care about constants like 5*n is just O(n)   and   N^2/2  is just O(N^2)
